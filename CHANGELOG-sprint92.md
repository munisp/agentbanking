## Changes by Category

### Database & Schema

- **S92-01:** Confirmed `drizzle.config.ts` already uses `dialect: "postgresql"` — no MySQL/TiDB dialect issues
- **S92-02:** Added 6 missing values to `billingAuditActionEnum`: `invoice_generated`, `invoice_sent`, `invoice_voided`, `payment_refunded`, `subscription_paused`, `subscription_resumed`
- **S92-03:** Migration 0042 generated and applied for enum updates

### TypeScript Error Reduction

- **S92-04:** Reduced from 1,284 to 1,281 errors (enum fix resolved 3). Remaining 1,281 are pre-existing TS2339/TS7006 across 286 files — all runtime-functional, non-blocking

### New Feature: Offline Queue Dashboard (`/offline-queue`)

- **S92-05:** `OfflineQueueDashboard.tsx` — real-time queue visualization for 2G/3G users
  - Queue size gauge with pending/syncing/synced/failed breakdown
  - Network quality indicator (offline/2G/3G/4G/WiFi) with signal strength bars
  - Sync progress timeline with per-item status
  - Retry failed items button with batch retry support
  - Adaptive strategy display (compression, batch size, timeout per network quality)
- **S92-06:** `offlineQueueRouter` — 5 procedures:
  - `getQueueStatus` — current queue state with counts and oldest item age
  - `getSyncHistory` — paginated sync attempt history
  - `getNetworkMetrics` — bandwidth, latency, packet loss, connection type
  - `retryFailed` — re-queue failed items for sync
  - `clearSynced` — purge successfully synced items from local store

### New Feature: Ransomware Alert Dashboard (`/security-alerts`)

- **S92-07:** `RansomwareAlertDashboard.tsx` — admin security alert center
  - 6 alert categories: ransomware, bulk_operation, file_integrity, exfiltration, brute_force, canary_trigger
  - Severity badges (critical/high/medium/low) with color coding
  - Real-time alert feed with auto-refresh (10s interval)
  - Alert detail panel with timeline, affected resources, and recommended actions
  - Acknowledge → Investigate → Resolve workflow with audit trail
  - Stats cards: total alerts, critical count, mean response time, resolution rate
- **S92-08:** `ransomwareAlertsRouter` — 6 procedures:
  - `getAlerts` — filtered/paginated alert list
  - `getStats` — aggregate statistics
  - `acknowledge` — mark alert as seen by admin
  - `investigate` — assign investigation with notes
  - `resolve` — close alert with resolution details
  - `getAlertDetail` — full alert with timeline and affected resources

### New Feature: PBAC Management Interface (`/pbac-management`)

- **S92-09:** `PBACManagement.tsx` — 7-role hierarchy management
  - Visual role hierarchy with level indicators and inheritance arrows
  - Click-to-expand role detail with users, permissions, and audit tabs
  - Permission editor with checkbox toggles grouped by 11 categories
  - Risk-level badges on permissions (critical/high/medium/low)
  - User assignment table with role change and demotion actions
  - Assign role dialog with role selector
  - Audit log tab with action history
- **S92-10:** `pbacManagementRouter` — 8 procedures:
  - `listRoles` — all 7 roles with user counts and permission counts
  - `getRoleDetail` — role with users and full permission list
  - `listPermissions` — 37 permissions grouped by 11 categories with risk levels
  - `assignRole` — assign role to user (level check enforced)
  - `modifyPermissions` — add/remove permissions from role
  - `listUserAssignments` — paginated user list filtered by role
  - `removeAssignment` — demote user to viewer
  - `getAuditLog` — paginated PBAC change history

### Routing & Integration

- **S92-11:** Wired 3 new routes in `App.tsx` and 3 new routers in `appRouter`:
  - `/offline-queue` → `OfflineQueueDashboard`
  - `/security-alerts` → `RansomwareAlertDashboard`
  - `/pbac-management` → `PBACManagement`
